Project title : Attendance portal

I created this project where students can register/login to this portal . they can mark present/absent in attendance in their respective classes and also they can view their average attendance percentage on their student dashboard . Additionally added a task submission form in the each class section (near the attendance named Task) where the student can submit their daily task . later their task as taken for the valuation in the Rate Task section in the mentor dashboard

Here comes the mentor part where he can valuate their score out of 10 and submit his form . Then the form goes to the Tasks section in student dashboard where the student can see their task score in My task section and they can also see the task that are yet to be graded .
student can see their overall submission of tasks in student dashboard

NOTE : I merged the student and mentor dashboard part in same webpage to make the project more understandable .

Used Express.js framework,jsonwebtoken for Authentication and MongoDB for storing the data.
Used bcryptjs for password hashing.
